Project: Spatial Tuning of Motion-Induced Position Shifts Revealed by Continuous Nulling 

- Continuous tacking/nulling psychophysics
      - Main: Eccentricity x SF effects (spaial tuning, dependncies)
      - Variations: motion-orientation, MT-physiology, etc (still developing for future projects)
  
- Main experiment code:
     - WindyMoIndPosShiftNulling_hinge_SF.m 

- Main analysis code:
      - doit.m (trkDat.m)
      - ccgSF.m
      - runCCGAnova_demo.m (runCCGAnova.m, plotCCGAnovaResults.m)

- Main structures (in secured server):
      - zebvp.mat
      - aptvp.mat
      - cfxvp.mat
      - cfcvp.mat
